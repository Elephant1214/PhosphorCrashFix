# Phosphor Crash Fix
A simple coremod that fixes the crashes caused by Phosphor's outdated injection annotations when using versions of mixin newer than 0.7.x.\
This mod does nothing without Phosphor present, as it exists to fix an issue with Phosphor.\
\
A few other mods fix this in Mixin by adding compatibility for 0.7.x, but this fixes the issue with the mod.\
\
This is marked as required on both sides because having Phosphor on the client will still cause the same crash even if you don't load into singleplayer. It is otherwise not required if you don't have Phosphor on your client.\
